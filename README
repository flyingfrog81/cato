Cato is free software for applying licenses to your source code files. You
can customize cato changing the cato.cfg file that you find in ~/.cato/ and
adding license textual files in ~/cato/licenses/.  License files can contain
<owner> and <email> textual tags which will be replaced with cato
informations.  Embedded license versions will be applied on the first empty
line of each source file scanned, if no empty line is found, no license is
applied.  In its normal behaviour cato apply the license to the files given as
arguments on the command line, while using -d option it scans the given
directory for file extensions specified as command line arguments. If -r is
provided in conjunction with -d, all the directory tree is scanned starting
from the supplied dir.
